# TakeMyCoupon
Data Exploration/Visualization:

Small project based on dataset that helps me determine whether or not someone will take a coupon and use it.
After reviewing the coupon dataset, the bulk of people that used the coupons were primarily focused on coffee shops and inexpensive food. Further review is needed to determine the catagories needed to classify the perfect subject that will respond positively to the coupons.
There are various graphs in my python file that describe the behaviour of the data. The graphs are usefull in finding out the target audience.
